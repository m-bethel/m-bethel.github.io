                    <h3 class="platform-title">Economy & Cost of Living</h3>
                    <p class="platform-description">Our economic plan revolves around increased economic freedom for Americans with an emphasis on personal responsibility. We provide tax cuts that keep more money in Americans' pockets and less in an ineffective bureaucratic system. We'll participate in social service reforms that incentivize Americans to pursue the American dream and better careers. We pledge to increase government funding to identify and reduce welfare fraud, which costs US taxpayers billions annually.</p>

                    <h3 class="platform-title">Housing Affordability</h3>
                    <p class="platform-description">Our plan for housing affordability revolves around monopoly law principles from the early 20th century. Large corporations with trillions in assets are purchasing homes in bulk and artificially driving up housing and rent prices. We pledge to eliminate corporations like BlackRock from purchasing large shares of private property and advocate for lower interest rates to help Americans afford homes.</p>

                    <h3 class="platform-title">Healthcare Access</h3>
                    <p class="platform-description">Our approach to healthcare access begins and ends with insurance reform. Americans have been plagued by rising healthcare costs and heavy insurance payments for far too long. We will take a stand against the insurance industries to lower rates for millions of Americans, including reduced premiums and removing government bailouts. Americans shouldn't have to pay insurance and taxes to fund the same companies.</p>

                    <h3 class="platform-title">Immigration & Border Control</h3>
                    <p class="platform-description">Our immigration policy is simple: America is a great country and millions want to create a new life here. We support reforms making immigration more accessible for those legally pursuing emigration and offering valuable contributions. Conversely, we support the DHS and its branches serving the American people. Illegal immigration must be stopped as it damages national security, our economy, and negatively affects our legal immigration system.</p>

                    <h3 class="platform-title">Environmental Policy</h3>
                    <p class="platform-description">Our environmental policy focuses on creating clean and efficient energy that can modernize and revolutionize the American power grid. We believe in nuclear power and stand by its advocates. Our party strives to double the number of nuclear power plants in the US by 2050, offering a stable financial future for millions of workers with high wages and great benefits.</p>

                    <h3 class="platform-title">Voting Rights</h3>
                    <p class="platform-description">To provide security and restore trust in US elections, we believe Voter IDs must be presented prior to voting. To increase voter registration and turnout, we encourage each state to issue a free legally acceptable form of ID to its citizens. We'll push to make election day a federal holiday, guaranteeing those who wish to vote have the opportunity to do so.</p>

                    <h3 class="platform-title">Tax Reduction</h3>
                    <p class="platform-description">Americans are taxed on everything—what we earn, what we spend, and the usage of what we spend, among many other things. We will strive to reduce double taxation and identify redundant taxes that unfairly harm Americans' pocketbooks. We'll avoid significant additions to the national deficit by strongly opposing increases in military funding and drawing a hard line against American tax dollars being sent overseas.</p>

                    <h3 class="platform-title">Criminal Justice Reform</h3>
                    <p class="platform-description">Americans deserve a competent and effective criminal justice system. Judges and district attorneys should be held accountable for releasing dangerous criminals who go on to commit more crimes. Violent repeat offenders and serial offenders should incur harsher sentences to eliminate habitual crime. For low-level and non-violent offenders, we focus on rehabilitation and reincorporation into society, allowing them to work under proper supervision and hold jobs paying fair wages.</p>

                    <h3 class="platform-title">Political Reform & Term Limits</h3>
                    <p class="platform-description">Being part of the political machine should not be a lifelong career. We support legislation mandating that no politician may hold federal office for more than 12 total years. Politicians' wages should be reduced during their time in office but with increased pension and benefits for their service. We require US Senators to be US-born citizens or born in American territories. Compensation can never exceed 150% of constituents' average income. No single-issue bills allowed.</p>

                    <h3 class="platform-title">International Diplomacy</h3>
                    <p class="platform-description">Our message is clear and concise: American taxpayer dollars belong to American taxpayers. We will exit NATO and stop sending taxpayer money to foreign governments. We prioritize American interests and invest in our own communities rather than funding overseas conflicts and international organizations. Our media presence reflects the need for national financial responsibility and the importance of national independence.</p>

                    <h3>Fundraising Approach</h3>
                    <p>Our general philosophy for acquiring funds includes donations and crowdfunding as important elements of generating revenue. We plan on holding numerous fundraising events such as auctions and rallies to generate interest in our party, find and work with associates and volunteers, and create revenue. We will use merchandise sales and collaborations with private companies (such as firearm brand merchandise and conservative companies), and we will apply for government grants and funding when applicable. Our approach focuses on keeping more money in Americans' pockets and reducing government wastefulness, targeting blue-collar workers, trade workers, students entering the workforce, and business owners feeling the squeeze from excessive taxation.</p>

                    <h3>Recruitment Strategy</h3>
                    <p>We plan on recruiting staff and volunteers via the internet as well as in-person events. Our party website and affiliate organizations will have links for interested individuals to find local volunteer opportunities. Our social media pages will post about events and activities, and we will ask for community support. We believe in working with other similarly interested groups and attending large events hosted by organizations such as TPUSA or PragerU, or individual politicians and pundits. Using internet job recruiting and volunteer-finding platforms will be especially beneficial as we can post descriptions of who and what we're looking for and filter replies from those who respond. We want to recruit passionate volunteers, dedicated staff, and everyday citizens ready to take back their government.</p>

                    <p>Our primary target audience is going to be those who are conservative or libertarian in nature. We want to focus on the middle class and suburban Americans as we believe our platform and policies will offer them unique opportunities they won't find elsewhere. Although moderates may not agree with all our policies or ideals, we believe we can offer them enough quality of life improvements through our policies that we'll be able to persuade many of them to side with us over larger or more established parties. We're reaching out to working families, renters, first-time homebuyers, legal immigrants, small business owners, STEM students, veterans, and anyone tired of career politicians and government waste.</p>

                    <p>The brunt of our campaign will use the internet, which is the modern town square, to publish our ideas and build support for our message and mission. We want to use our talented staff to create active and engaging social media profiles with large influence on popular platforms such as YouTube and Instagram, as well as through podcasts and talk radio. We want to have as many small town hall meetings as we can and strive to build a new chapter of the Liberty Party in every city willing and able to participate. We'll hold large regional conferences and rallies to further expand our influence and gain recognition with wider communities. We also want to establish a strong presence on campuses and universities across the nation, using data, evidence, testimonials, and success stories to showcase the effectiveness of our policies.</p>

                        <div class="reflection-text">
                            <p><strong>My Partner:</strong> Miles Bethel (served as political candidate)</p>
                            <p><strong>Most Challenging Aspect:</strong> The most challenging thing was identifying what sorts of policies or topics were important enough to represent the foundational stances of our party. It was also challenging to come up with a series of beliefs and policies that were distinct enough to be separate from policies that exist in mainstream US politics. We didn't want to copy certain party platforms word for word, so it required a decent bit of brainstorming to get as far as we did. It was relatively simple for us to create our policies and platform once we identified what we wanted to talk about because Miles and I have rather similar beliefs and viewpoints on most things we discussed. For me, as campaign manager, it was more challenging to take the policies we created and then create a custom plan to implement our plan.</p>
                            <p><strong>Role Impact:</strong> As the campaign manager, my focus was on implementation—figuring out how to execute our policies, generate sufficient funds to reach intended audiences, and form strategies to attract individual demographics. The candidate role allowed Miles to focus on public opinion and public image, while I had to think about the practical logistics of making our vision reality.</p>
                            <p><strong>Key Lesson:</strong> I learned through this activity in both parts 1 and 2 that political parties are incredibly complex. Not only do you need to generate a large sum of money to even become or stay relevant, it requires a large workforce to keep any operation running smoothly. I also learned that it is much more difficult to say how you want to do something and have an associated plan than it is to just say you have an intended policy and will support it. As a campaign manager, you have to figure out implementation. Working with politics is much more labor intensive than I would have otherwise presumed.</p>

                            <p><strong>My Partner:</strong> Jacob Schofield </p>
                            <p><strong>Most Challenging Aspect:</strong> The most difficult part about creating a unified platform was the overall minutia. There are so many laws already in place that I feel complicates the system beyond human awareness. By human awareness, I mean it is simply impossible to be aware of all federal laws and how to simultaneously obey them. Deciding which issues to prioritize and how to clearly articulate positions that would appeal to our target audience while staying true to our principles was difficult and time-consuming. We found that it was virtually impossible for us to define what we would like to change without under-defining something else entirely, or violating some other statute. We spent a majority considerable time debating the nuances of each platform plank.</p>
                            <p><strong>Role Impact:</strong> As a Candidate, the decisions I made were based around public opinion and public image, rather than how many laws we would need to change to implement our party. In essence, the decisions were made based on how we felt about them in relation to how the public would react. </p>
                            <p><strong>Key Lesson:</strong> I learned that political parties function as coalitions that must appeal to multiple constituencies while maintaining a coherent identity. I learned there is a reason why campaigns are costly and require no small effort or funds. Simply looking into how expensive it would be to hire groups of people to manage all the minutia is exorbitant. That and how much leg work that goes into the background behind just the “idea”. </p>
